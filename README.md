# Weenix
A full operating system kernel, based on Unix, built as a semester-long project in CS 402 (Operating Systems) at USC.

## Content
Procs - Threads, processes, and synchronization primitives.

VFS (Virtual File System) - A polymorphic interface between the operating system kernel and the various file systems (such as S5FS and device drivers).

VM (Virtual Memory) - Userspace address space management, running user-level code, servicing system calls, and basically everything else needed to combine all of the previous componenets into a fully functioning operating system. This includes virtual memory maps, handling page faults, memory management via anonymous objects and shadow objects, and system calls (in particular, the fork syscall).

## Important Notes
This is a placeholder repo with no code to respect USC's Academic Code. If you are a potential employer and would like to look at the code, please send me an [email](amylee.lyq@gmail.com).
